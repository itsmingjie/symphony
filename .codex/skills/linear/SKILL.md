# Linear GraphQL

Use this skill for raw Linear GraphQL work during Symphony app-server sessions.

## Primary tool

Use the `linear_graphql` client tool exposed by Symphony's app-server session.
It reuses Symphony's configured Linear auth for the session.

Tool input:

```json
{
  "query": "query or mutation document",
  "variables": {
    "optional": "graphql variables object"
  }
}
```

Tool behavior:

- Send one GraphQL operation per tool call.
- Treat a top-level `errors` array as a failed GraphQL operation even if the
  tool call itself completed.
- Keep queries/mutations narrowly scoped; ask only for the fields you need.
- Use `issue(id: $id)` with the internal Linear issue id from the Symphony prompt context.

## Discovering unfamiliar operations

When you need an unfamiliar mutation, input type, or object field, use targeted
introspection through `linear_graphql`.

List mutation names:

```graphql
query ListMutations {
  __type(name: "Mutation") {
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Inspect a specific input object:

```graphql
query CommentCreateInputShape {
  __type(name: "CommentCreateInput") {
    inputFields {
      name
      type {
        kind
        name
        ofType {
          kind
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common workflows

### Query the current issue by internal id

In Symphony, the current issue's internal Linear id is usually already present
in prompt context. Use it directly:

```graphql
query IssueDetails($id: String!) {
  issue(id: $id) {
    id
    identifier
    title
    url
    description
    state {
      id
      name
      type
    }
    project {
      id
      name
    }
    attachments {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        url
        sourceType
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you only have a human-readable ticket key like `MT-686`, do not guess the
schema from memory. First inspect `IssueFilter` and `TeamFilter` with
introspection, then construct a filter using valid fields such as `number` and
`team.key`.

### Query team workflow states for an issue

Use this before changing issue state when you need the exact `stateId`:

```graphql
query IssueTeamStates($id: String!) {
  issue(id: $id) {
    id
    team {
      id
      key
      name
      states {
        nodes {
          id
          name
          type
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Move an issue to a different state

Use `issueUpdate` with the destination `stateId`:

```graphql
mutation MoveIssueToState($id: String!, $stateId: String!) {
  issueUpdate(id: $id, input: { stateId: $stateId }) {
    success
    issue {
      id
      identifier
      state {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Attach a GitHub PR to an issue

Use the GitHub-specific attachment mutation when linking a PR:

```graphql
mutation AttachGitHubPR($issueId: String!, $url: String!, $title: String) {
  attachmentLinkGitHubPR(
    issueId: $issueId
    url: $url
    title: $title
    linkKind: links
  ) {
    success
    attachment {
      id
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
```

If you only need a plain URL attachment and do not care about GitHub-specific
link metadata, use:

```graphql
mutation AttachURL($issueId: String!, $url: String!, $title: String) {
  attachmentLinkURL(issueId: $issueId, url: $url, title: $title) {
    success
    attachment {
      id
      title
      url
    }
  }
}
```

### Introspection patterns used during schema discovery

Use these when the exact field or mutation shape is unclear:

```graphql
query QueryFields {
  __type(name: "Query") {
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```graphql
query IssueFieldArgs {
  __type(name: "Query") {
    fields {
      name
      args {
        name
        type {
          kind
          name
          ofType {
            kind
            name
            ofType {
              kind
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage rules

- Use `linear_graphql` for issue queries, state changes, and ad-hoc Linear API
  operations.
- Prefer the narrowest issue lookup that matches what you already know:
  key -> identifier search -> internal id.
- For state transitions, fetch team states first and use the exact `stateId`
  instead of hardcoding names inside mutations.
- Prefer `attachmentLinkGitHubPR` over a generic URL attachment when linking a
  GitHub PR to a Linear issue.
- Do not introduce new raw-token shell helpers for GraphQL access.
- If you need shell work for uploads, only use it for signed upload URLs
  returned by `fileUpload`; those URLs already carry the needed authorization.
